# Workflow Templates

This folder contains fill-in templates for the stage-by-stage lesson lifecycle.

Use these files to keep implementation practical, reviewable, and historically traceable.

## How to use

1. Check `git branch --show-current`, `git status --short`, and
   `git log -1 --oneline` before editing.
2. Confirm that the branch belongs to the intended stage group and is based on
   the updated default branch after the previous pull request was merged.
3. Duplicate the relevant template from `Workflow/templates/`.
4. Save it in `Workflow/records/` with a date prefix, for example:
   - `2026-07-14-stage-0-scope.md`
   - `2026-07-15-stage-1-dataset.md`
   - `2026-07-18-stage-4-slides.md`
   - `2026-07-22-exercise-blueprint.md`
5. Add one short entry to `Workflow/STAGE_LOG.md` summarizing what changed,
   including the branch and pull request.
6. Link the record file in your PR description.

The Stage 2 and Stage 4 records contain mandatory story maps. Complete the relevant story map and knowledge-state ledger first, then stop and obtain explicit human approval before drafting full student-facing prose or slide text. Learning-materials and presentation story maps require separate approvals. Record the approver, date, decision, and requested revisions; general autonomy, approval of scope or data, silence, and later artifact review do not satisfy this gate. Keep `Internal role`, `Student-facing heading`, and `Speaker note` separate, run the audits, set `Story-map status` to `complete`, and set `Human story-map approval` to `approved` only after explicit agreement. The drafting agent and independent reviewer must verify the matching record at the relevant later review gate.

## Required branch and pull-request boundaries

| Pull request | Stages | Suggested branch | Start condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Planning | 0-1 | `lesson/<week>-scope-data` | New branch from the default branch |
| Written materials | 2-3 | `lesson/<week>-skripta` | Planning PR merged; branch from updated default branch |
| Presentation | 4-5 | `lesson/<week>-presentation` | Written-materials PR merged; branch from updated default branch |
| Exercise | Post-presentation | `lesson/<week>-exercises` | Presentation approved and PR merged; branch from updated default branch |

Do not continue from one group into the next on the same branch. Before opening
each pull request, check `git status --short` and `git diff --stat`; include only
the intended stage group, its workflow records, and generated outputs belonging
to sources changed in that group.

Open the pull request when the stage-group draft is ready, perform its human
review and revisions on that same branch/PR, and merge it before creating the
next stage branch. Assistants must still obtain user authorization before
creating or switching branches, pushing, or opening/merging pull requests.

For release preparation, post-merge validation, and publication receipts, follow the [canonical publication workflow](../../_internal/.ai/core/publication.md#release-preparation-and-recordkeeping). Workflow record-copying and stage-log steps apply to authoring and pre-merge preparation. Post-merge release results go in the GitHub Release description and leave the lesson working tree unchanged; actual source fixes retain the normal branch and PR workflow.

## Recommended sequence

1. `stage-0-scope.md`
2. `stage-1-dataset.md`
3. `stage-2-learning-materials.md` (includes the mandatory learning-materials story map)
4. `stage-4-slides.md` (includes the mandatory per-slide story map and the Stage 5 presentation review)
5. `exercise-blueprint.md` (post-presentation exercise design, validation, independent review, and human review)
6. `stage-5-review-release.md` (pre-merge preparation and external post-merge receipt)

## Why this exists

- Keeps weekly lesson production consistent.
- Makes review faster (same structure every week).
- Preserves a clear history of decisions and revisions.
